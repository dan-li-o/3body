title: "Physics has never existed"
date-modified: last-modified
---

Yang Dong was a physicist. A string theorist. And she killed herself.

Her note was only one line long:

> Physics has never existed, and will never exist.

A sentence like that does not belong in a suicide note. It belongs as the opening line of a metaphysics textbook. But to Yang, it was not philosophy. It was despair.

For Wang Miao, a nano-material scientist, the note was incomprehensible. How could physics *never* have existed, when it is the skeleton of modern life? Lasers, satellites, GPS, semiconductors---all monuments to physical laws. What did Yang see that broke her faith so completely?

When asked, Yang’s partner, the physicist Ding Yi, did not answer with words. He answered with a demonstration.

## The Pool Table

Science has always loved metaphors of colliding spheres. Newton used them to explain light,^[Issac Newton laid the foundations for the corpuscular theory of light, which states that light is made up of small discrete particles called "corpuscles" (little particles). These corpuscles travel in a strightline with a finite velocity.] Maxwell sketched them to understand Saturn's rings,^[In 1859, Maxwell published his essay "on the stability of the motion of Staurn's rings" [-@maxwell1859stability], which solved a mystery that had eluded scientists for 200 years---how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away, or crashing into Saturn. In this essay, Maxwell proved that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced to break up into blobs. He concluded that rings must be composed of numerous small particles. He was awarded the Adams Prize.] and Einstein invoked them in discussions of Brownian motions.^[In 1905, Einstein provided the first quantitative explanation for Brownian motion, suspended pollen seeds in water moving in an erratic, random motion. In this essay [-@einstein1905motion], he proposed that Brownian motion was caused by random bombardment of visible particles by invisible, constantly moving atoms and molecules.] Ding Yi continued the tradition---since the 19th century, billiards have been routinely used in physics textbooks for illustration.

He placed the ball at one end of the table, struck it with the cue at a fixed angle and force, and watched it collide with the side cushions. The rebound was predictable. Then he placed the ball elsewhere, struck again with the same angle and force. The collisions traced out an identical pattern. He did it again. And again.

Five times. Five experiments.

Each yielded the same result.

"Aren't you shocked by the results?" Ding asked rhetorically. Wang did not know how to respond. 

“Come on, let's celebrate. We've discovered a great principle of nature: *The laws of physics are invariant across space and time*.” 

This was no trivial statement. It is one of the great articles of faith in science: that laws are not local customs, but universal decrees. Strike a ball here, or there, today or tomorrow---it doesn’t matter. The physical laws remain the same.

Try it yourself. Ding Yi’s pool table has been reconstructed here.

Drag the ball anywhere you like. Release it. A cue will strike with the same direction and force each time. Watch the numbers: position, velocity, acceleration. Try it again, and again.

Notice how the experiment becomes boring. That boredom is the signature of a law.

## The Seduction of Invariance

Science seduces us with boredom. That is its secret charm. We want the universe to behave, not to surprise. Every replication, every repeated experiment that yields the same result, feels like a reassurance that we live in an orderly cosmos.

Philosophers gave this reassurance a name: the Principle of the Uniformity of Nature.David Hume, the great skeptic, articulated it in the 18th century: the assumption that the future will resemble the past; that nature tomorrow will behave like nature today; that "*the course of nature continues always uniformly the same*."^[Hume never named this principle as-is in his *Treatise*. He says, "if Reason determin'd us, it would proceed upon that principle that instances, of which we have had no experience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the course of nature continues alasy uniformly the same" [@hume2000treatise]. For convenience, philosophers refert to this claim of similarity or resemblance between observed and unobserved regularties as the "Uniformity Principle," "Resemblance Principle," or the "Principle of Uniformity of Nature." Read more in @henderson2018problem [].].  

Across cultures and centuries, thinkers spontaneously embraced the principle without hesitation. Thales sought a single element to ground the flux of the world. Aristotle believed nature’s motions could be classified because they followed regular causes. Xunzi wrote 天行有常---“the heavens move with constancy.”^[Another translation: There is a constancy to the activties of Heaven, from @xunzi2015xunzi [p.175].] The Stoics saw the cosmos ordered by logos. Aquinas and medieval scholastics  argued that God’s creation was rational and therefore reliable. Galileo, Kepler, and Newton all assumed their laws applied everywhere.^[In 1638, Galileo Galilei published *Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences*[-@galilei1914discourses], his final book and a scientific testament. The first half of the book deals with the causes and mathematics of how bodies break and the acceleration of falling bodies. The second new science, described in the latter of the book, deals with the mathematical descriptions and laws of local motions---motions of all matter. See more in @machamer2021galileo []. In contrast, Kepler's attitude is more ambiguous. But at least, he believes that his laws apply to all planets as he says, in his *The Harmony of the World*, "But it is absolutely certain and exact that the proportion between the periodic times of *any two planets* is precisely the sesquialterate proportion (i.e., the ratio of 3:2) of their mean distances..."[-@kepler2021harmonies]. Lastly, Newton wrote in the preface of *The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*, "I wish we could derive the rest of the phænomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each other..."[-@newton1846principia].] Bacon made nature a system governed by its own laws and the very source of knowledge. And knowledge is power.  

This conviction---that the rhythm of nature is reliable, and thus knowable---is what keeps us from superstition. However framed---through omen or through reason---the majority have trusted that the world follows patterns so that we are not at the mercy of whimsical gods.

That trust is what makes science possible. Once we believed in order rather than caprice, knowledge could accumulate. Experiments became expected to repeat, results communicable, and science emerged as a shared project. This conviction, more than any single discovery, is what allowed the modern worldview to take root. ^[It is extremely difficult---if not impossible---to pin down the exact date of such a naturalistic turn. Most history of science textbooks agrees that the origin of western science should at least start from natural philosophy of acient Greece, if not Egypt and Mesopotamia. See Lindberg's *The Beginnings of Western Science* [-@lindberg2010beginnings] or McClenllan III's *Science and Technology in World History* [-@mcclellan2015science]. However, the naturalistic turn does not mean that scientific naturalism is entirely free of references to God or the supernatural. See more in *Science without God?* by @harrison2019science [].]

Without the Principle of Uniformity of Nature, replication collapses, prediction is impossible, and “law” becomes an empty word. With it, the modern scientific worldview takes shape: not pleasing the gods, but trusting that the world itself is knowable, and that what we learned here and now will apply tomorrow and elsewhere.

Ding Yi concluded forcefully, 

> ... a great principle of nature: The laws of physics are invariant across space and time. All the physical laws of human history, from Archimedes' principle to string theory, and all the scientific discoveries and intellectual fruits of our species are the by-products of this great law. 

But here is the scandal: Hume could never prove it. No one has. The uniformity of nature is not a discovery. It is a bet. A metaphysical faith disguised as an empirical law.^[It is worth noting that not all philosophers agree that Principle of Uniformity of Nature (PUN) is a metaphysical postulate. For example, Mill asserts that PUN is an empirical truth where as Russell treats PUN as a postulate, a form of "wishful thinking." See @Salmon1953-SALTUO [].] Even in the twentieth century, Einstein marveled that “the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.”^[This quote is adapted for readability. In his essay "Physics and Reality" [-@einstein1936physics], Einstein wrote, "...the production of some sort of order among sense impressions, this order being produced by the creation of general concepts, relations between these concepts, and by definite relations of some kind between the concepts and sense experience. It is in this sense that the world of our sense experiences is comprehensible. The fact that it is comprehensible is a miracle."]

Yang Dong’s suicide note was an act of apostasy.

## The Lawful Table

Now, physicists don’t spend their lives rolling pool balls the same way over and over again. They juggle a zoo of variables---spin, friction, imperfections, air currents, hidden quirks of the felt---each one a potential troublemaker, each one an invitation for variance and disorder. 

And yet, beneath the clutter, the pursuit is the same: change the knobs, keep the laws. Find that invariance that stands like granite. 

::: {#wid-pool-sim .widget}
```{=html}
{{< include /partials/pool-invariance.html >}}
```
The Lawful Table---many knobs. 
:::

Set the ball, pick an angle, choose a force, slide the friction. Watch the ball run like a wild child across the felt. Then, look to the right: the number that refuses to panic: total energy. The surface changes, the invariant doesn’t. Complexity multiplies, but the promise of invariance holds. That’s what a law feels like from the inside. 

Physics *hides* its treasures in invariants. They are its balance sheets. No matter how wild the day’s trading—balls ricocheting, particles colliding—the books close clean. Energy in, energy out. Momentum tallied to the last decimal.

## The Lawful Coin

A curious reader might object: not all outcomes are replicable the way billiard collisions are. What about random events---like flipping a coin? Where is the invariance there?

Let’s try it.

::: {#wid-coin-sim .widget}
```{=html}
{{< include /partials/coin-flip.html >}}
```
Coin Flip Device — click to flip; chart shows p̂ over trials.
:::

Flip the coin as many times as you like. At first, the results look noisy, even chaotic. Ten flips tell you nothing. But flip a hundred, a thousand, and something remarkable happens: the wildly fluctuating ratio between heads and tails begins to settle. Chaos turns into pattern. Noise reveals order.

Pop the champagne---you’ve just discovered the **Law of Large Numbers**. It states that the average outcome of a random experiment approaches its expected value as the number of trials increases. This is the invariance of chance: the more experiments you run, the closer you get to the hidden probability of the coin. It isn't merely a statistical curiosity; it's a bedrock principle---the universe’s quiet promise of consistency, assuring us that even in the realm of chance, a hidden invariance governs.

Jacob Bernoulli, who first proved this and published it posthumously in 1713,^[In a book titled *Ars Conjectandi (The Art of Conjecturing)* [-@bernoulli2006art]] called it his *golden theorem*. Casinos thrive on it. Insurance companies rely on it. Weather forecasts whisper it. The law promises that randomness itself contains a rhythm, and that with enough patience, averages will converge.

But hidden in the proof is an often overlooked clause: each trial must be *independently* and *identically distributed*. Your previous toss must not interfere with the next toss; a toss here or there, today or tomorrow, it makes no difference, as if all these tosses are drawn from the same deck. This is Hume's Principle in disguise: uniformity all over again. The law of large numbers depends on the same bet—that nature behaves consistently, yet probabilistically, across time and space. 

It looks like victory: even in randomness, invariance survives. Only when such invariance holds can statistics, probability, and the sciences built on them exist at all.

## The Unlawful Table

“I still don’t understand what you’re getting at,” Wang asked. How is this relevant to Yang’s suicide?

Ding lit a cigarette, “Imagine another set of results. The first time, the white ball drove the black ball into the pocket. The second time, the black ball bounced away. The third time, the black ball flew onto the ceiling. The fourth time, the black ball shot around the room like a frighted sparrow, finally taking refuge in your jacket pocket. The fifth time, the black ball flew away at nearly the speed of light, breaking the edge of the pool table, shooting through the wall, and leaving the Earth and Solar system, just like Asimov once described. What would you think then?”

Indeed, a demon's pool table. 

After a long silence, Ding explained that physicists' expensive “pool tables”---high-energy particle accelerators–constructed on different continents, have been consistently failing to yield the same results with the same experimental setup. 

Now imagine a similarly unlawful coin. When you flipped it, the first time, it gave you heads; the second time, it flew outside of the room; the third time, it hovered in midair humming like a hive of bees; the fourth time, it spun forever without landing, defying gravity’s grasp; the fifth time, it burst into flame and fizzled into ash, leaving only a scorch mark on the table. 

> ... there seemed to be no pattern.

In the story, the leap from a lack of pattern to Yang Dong’s last words that “physics has never existed” is too quick. In reality, physicists are never afraid of “no obvious patterns” because they know they are dealing with complex situations with many knobs and sometimes with worlds governed by probabilities, not certainties, as exemplified by quantum physics.

Yang’s true crisis arises not from “no pattern” nor is it from simple replication failures, but from a fundamental betrayal of both scientific methods and their underlying principles.

## Betrayal of Scientific Methods

Scientific method is not a single recipe but a set of practices.^[This is, of course, when we adopt views in Longino's *Science as Social Knowledge* [-@longino1990science].] We design experiments so they can be replicated. We build theories so they can predict. We subject hypotheses to conditions where they might be falsified. We rely on measurement and quantification so that results can be communicated and compared. We use statistical inference so that from noisy samples we can draw stable generalizations. And we expose findings to peer scrutiny so that knowledge accumulates collectively, not privately. All these are parts of scientific methods that allow scientists to verify findings, build consensus, and gradually construct a towering edifice of knowledge about the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies. 

However, all of these methods presuppose that the world itself is stable enough for yesterday’s data to apply tomorrow---uniformity of nature. Even failures to replicate previous results should be invariant. Without invariance, replication is meaningless, prediction impossible, falsification incoherent.

Yet, what Yang Dong and her peers were facing was a *complete lack of patterns*: identical setups yielded wildly different outcomes, so wild that even our best statistical tools could not capture the slight hint of invariance as if it were the demon's coin. 

Yang’s despair was not about complexity or chance---it was about the collapse of this scaffolding. A scientist can live with error and with noise; she cannot live with the treachery that makes her methods useless. 

## Emmy Noether's Gift

Yang Dong also killed herself because the Demon’s pool table broke the promises of all branches of physics, promises that follow **Noether's Theorem**. 

In 1915, Emmy Noether, German mathematician and lecturer at University of Göttingen without pay---merely because she was a woman---discovered a secret mathematical architecture beneath the laws of physics. She proved that, loosely speaking, whenever a physical system behaves the same regardless of where it is, when it is, or how it is oriented, there must exist a law of conservation.^[Read more in *Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem* [@neuenschwander2017emmy] and *Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe* [@lederman2011symmetry].]

Physicists call this kind of sameness a *symmetry*. We know the idea from everyday life: my left hand mirrors my right. If I flip one over, it overlays the other---a transformation that demonstrates the symmetry. Physicists extended this notion beyond mirror-images: a symmetry means the property of remaining invariant under any transformation. If a system remains the same from one moment to the immediate next, that is time symmetry. If it holds the same here as it does elsewhere---whether a nanometer or a million kilometers away, that is spatial symmetry. If it behaves the same no matter how we rotate it---even by the tiniest imperceptible angle, that is rotational symmetry. These are what physicists call continuous symmetries: sameness that holds not only in great leaps, but through every tiny shift so small that transformation is smooth. 

Her theorem reveals the astonishing consequence: every continuous symmetry guarantees a conservation law. Time symmetry guarantees energy is conserved. Spatial symmetry guarantees momentum is conserved. Rotational symmetry guarantees angular momentum is conserved. 

*Symmetry is the premise; conservation the promise.*

## The Horror of Demon's Pool Table 

No matter where you set the ball on the pool table, the energy conserves because there is spatial symmetry. But what if we broke the spatial symmetry?

Try again, but this time, on a demon’s pool table where you can choose how to break the spatial symmetry. 

::: {.widget #wid-pool-symmetry}
```{=html}
{{< include /partials/pool-symmetry.html >}}
```
Breaking Spatial Symmetry---same table, unlawful rules.
:::

Enable the Size Field and drag the ball across the table, you’ll notice its size alters. Hit it with a cue, watch how the kinetic energy bounces up and down as the ball moves across the table from left to right and right to left---when it is supposed to stay constant. The ball doesn’t look the same anymore when moving. Spatial symmetry is broken. Energy doesn’t conserve. 

Enable transmutation, and even worse things happen. The concept of energy doesn’t even apply anymore, let alone energy conservation. 

Only in this case, you own the pool table and can control whether and how to break symmetry. But imagine what scientists of pool tables have to face!

## Apostasy of Symmetry

Sometimes, reality is indeed stranger than fiction. In the 1950s, physicists did discover a strange phenomenon: subatomic particles called kaons and taus---they appear to be identical in every way, with the same mass, charge, and lifetime---decay into different products.

A. Zee later wrote, 

> The curcial idea which came to Lee and Yang is that Nature may respect parity in many of her laws, but not in the laws governing the weak interaction between particles. Imagine that one of the fundamental principles of our legal system, that the accused is presumed innocent until proven otherwise, is decreed to hold only for certain crimes, while for other crimes the opposite is to be the case. Just as judicial philosophers would surely cringe at this notion, physcists find Nature's selective violation of partiy rather discomforting philosophically.^[[@zee2015fearful p. 29]]

... [TODO]

Nobel Laureate, physicist Leon Lederman, and theoretical physicist Christopher Hill wrote, 

> We should add that experimentalists still often look for missing energy and momentum in their detectors in particle collisions, but this is always interpreted nowadays as evidence for a new particle, never as evidence for the breakdown of the conservation laws of energy and momentum. Our faith, or should we say confidence (as science is not faith-based), in the symmetries of the structure of space and time, and Noether’s theorem would, at this point, be very hard to shake.^[*Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe* by @lederman2011symmetry]

For Yang, who had as much faith as Lederman and Hill, this was the final betrayal. Symmetry was not just a mathematical trick but the deep covenant of nature. It was the bridge between invariance and conservation, the silent guarantor that science could still speak a coherent language. Everything that we ever know from physics, from quarks to quasars, was an illusion. To see symmetry dissolve was to see the pillars of the temple collapse.

*Physics has never existed, and will never exist.*
