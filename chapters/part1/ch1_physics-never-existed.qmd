title: "Physics has never existed"
---

Yang Dong was a physicist. A string theorist. And she killed herself.

Her note was only one line long:

> Physics has never existed, and will never exist.

A sentence like that does not belong in a suicide note. It belongs in the opening line of a metaphysics textbook. But Yang knew it was not philosophy. It was despair.

For Wang Miao, a nano-material scientist, the note was incomprehensible. How could physics *never* have existed, when it is the skeleton of modern life? Lasers, satellites, GPS, semiconductors---all monuments to physical laws. What did Yang see that broke her faith so completely?

When asked, Yang’s partner, the physicist Ding Yi, did not answer with words. He answered with a demonstration.

## The Pool Table

Science has always loved metaphors of colliding spheres. Newton used them to explain light, Descartes sketched them to describe celestial orbits, and Einstein invoked them in discussions of Brownian motions. Ding Yi continued the tradition---since the 19th century, billiards have been routinely used in physics textbooks for illustration.

He placed the ball at one end of the table, struck it with the cue at a fixed angle and force, and watched it collide with the side cushions. The rebound was predictable. Then he placed the ball elsewhere, struck again with the same angle and force. The collisions traced out an identical pattern. He did it again. And again.

Five times. Five experiments.

Each yielded the same result.

"Aren't you shocked by the results?" Ding asked rhetorically. Wang did not know how to respond. 

“Come on, let's celebrate. We've discovered a great principle of nature: *The laws of physics are invariant across space and time*.” 

This was no trivial statement. It is one of the great articles of faith in science: that laws are not local customs, but universal decrees. Strike a ball here, or there, today or tomorrow—it doesn’t matter. The physical laws remain the same.

Try it yourself. Ding Yi’s pool table has been reconstructed here.
(@wid-pool-sim). 

You can drag the ball anywhere on the pool table. As soon as you release it, a cue will hit it with the same direction and force. You can alter friction on the left. The status of the ball, i.e., position, velocity, and acceleration, will be tracked automatically and displayed on the right panel.

Pool simulation showing that with the same strike and friction, trajectories after collision are invariant regardless of where the ball is placed.

Now, you can repeat the experiments as many times as you wish. But you will notice, no matter where you drop the ball, as long as the friction that you set is the same, the ball moves in the same direction with the same changes in velocity and acceleration, respectively, since the ball is hit with the same strike. In other words, as long as the relevant inital conditions of experiments stay the same, the experimental results should also stay the same regardless when and where the experiments take place. 

In the novel, Ding Yi lit a cigarette and continued, 

> We ran the same expeirment five times. Four of the experiments differed in both location and time. Two of the experiments were at the same location but different times. Are you shocked by the results?

Ding dramatically gestured,

> Five times! Every colliding experiment yielded the exact same result!

Wang did not know how to respond. Ding said, 

> Come on, let's celebrate. We've discovered a great principle of nature: **The laws of physics are invariant across space and time.**
