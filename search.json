    "text": "2.1 The Pool Table\nYang Dong was a physicist. A string theorist. And she killed herself.\nHer note was only one line long:\nA sentence like that does not belong in a suicide note. It belongs as the opening line of a metaphysics textbook. But to Yang, it was not philosophy. It was despair.\nFor Wang Miao, a nano-material scientist, the note was incomprehensible. How could physics never have existed, when it is the skeleton of modern life? Lasers, satellites, GPS, semiconductors—all monuments to physical laws. What did Yang see that broke her faith so completely?\nWhen asked, Yang’s partner, the physicist Ding Yi, did not answer with words. He answered with a demonstration.\nScience has always loved metaphors of colliding spheres. Newton used them to explain light, Descartes sketched them to describe celestial orbits, and Einstein invoked them in discussions of Brownian motions. Ding Yi continued the tradition—since the 19th century, billiards have been routinely used in physics textbooks for illustration.\nHe placed the ball at one end of the table, struck it with the cue at a fixed angle and force, and watched it collide with the side cushions. The rebound was predictable. Then he placed the ball elsewhere, struck again with the same angle and force. The collisions traced out an identical pattern. He did it again. And again.\nFive times. Five experiments.\nEach yielded the same result.\n“Aren’t you shocked by the results?” Ding asked rhetorically. Wang did not know how to respond.\n“Come on, let’s celebrate. We’ve discovered a great principle of nature: The laws of physics are invariant across space and time.”\nThis was no trivial statement. It is one of the great articles of faith in science: that laws are not local customs, but universal decrees. Strike a ball here, or there, today or tomorrow—it doesn’t matter. The physical laws remain the same.\nTry it yourself. Ding Yi’s pool table has been reconstructed here.\nDrag the ball anywhere you like. Release it. A cue will strike with the same direction and force each time. Watch the numbers: position, velocity, acceleration. Try it again, and again.\nNotice how the experiment becomes boring. That boredom is the signature of a law.",

    "section": "2.2 The Seduction of Invariance",
    "text": "2.2 The Seduction of Invariance\nScience seduces us with boredom. That is its secret charm. We want the universe to behave, not to surprise. Every replication, every repeated experiment that yields the same result, feels like a reassurance that we live in an orderly cosmos.\nPhilosophers gave this reassurance a name: the Principle of the Uniformity of Nature. David Hume, the great skeptic, articulated it in the 18th century: the assumption that the future will resemble the past; that nature tomorrow will behave like nature today; that “the course of nature continues always uniformly the same.” \nAcross cultures and centuries, thinkers spontaneously embraced the principle without hesitation. Thales sought a single element to ground the flux of the world. Aristotle believed nature’s motions could be classified because they followed regular causes. Xunzi wrote 天行有常—“the heavens move with constancy.” The Stoics saw the cosmos ordered by logos. Aquinas and medieval scholastics argued that God’s creation was rational and therefore reliable. Galileo, Kepler, and Newton all assumed their laws applied everywhere. Bacon made nature a system governed by its own laws and the very source of knowledge. And knowledge is power.\nThis conviction—that the rhythm of nature is reliable, and thus knowable—is what keeps us from superstition. However framed—through omen or through reason—the majority have trusted that the world follows patterns so that we are not at the mercy of whimsical gods.\nThat trust is what makes science possible. Once we believed in order rather than caprice, knowledge could accumulate. Experiments became expected to repeat, results communicable, and science emerged as a shared project. This conviction, more than any single discovery, is what allowed the modern worldview to take root. \nWithout the Principle of Uniformity of Nature, replication collapses, prediction is impossible, and “law” becomes an empty word. With it, the modern scientific worldview takes shape: not pleasing the gods, but trusting that the world itself is knowable, and that what we learned here and now will apply tomorrow and elsewhere.\nDing Yi concluded forcefully,\n\n… a great principle of nature: The laws of physics are invariant across space and time. All the physical laws of human history, from Archimedes’ principle to string theory, and all the scientific discoveries and intellectual fruits of our species are the by-products of this great law.\n\nBut here is the scandal: Hume could never prove it. No one has. The uniformity of nature is not a discovery. It is a bet. A metaphysical faith disguised as an empirical law. Even in the twentieth century, Einstein marveled that “the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.”\nYang Dong’s suicide note was an act of apostasy.",

At first, the results look noisy, even chaotic. Ten flips tell you nothing. But flip a hundred, a thousand, and something remarkable happens: the wildly fluctuating ratio between heads and tails begins to settle. Chaos turns into pattern. Noise reveals order.\nPop the champagne—you’ve just discovered the Law of Large Numbers. It states that the average outcome of a random experiment approaches its expected value as the number of trials increases. This is the invariance of chance: the more experiments you run, the closer you get to the hidden probability of the coin. It isn’t merely a statistical curiosity; it’s a bedrock principle—the universe’s quiet promise of consistency, assuring us that even in the realm of chance, a hidden invariance governs.\nJacob Bernoulli, who first proved this in 1713, called it his golden theorem. Casinos thrive on it. Insurance companies rely on it. Weather forecasts whisper it. The law promises that randomness itself contains a rhythm, and that with enough patience, averages will converge.\nBut hidden in the proof is an often overlooked clause: each trial must be independently and identically distributed. Your previous toss must not interfere with the next toss; a toss here or there, today or tomorrow, it makes no difference, as if all these tosses are drawn from the same deck. This is Hume’s Principle in disguise: uniformity all over again. The law of large numbers depends on the same bet—that nature behaves consistently, yet probabilistically, across time and space.\nIt looks like victory: even in randomness, invariance survives. Only when such invariance holds can statistics, probability, and the sciences built on them exist at all.",

The first time, the white ball drove the black ball into the pocket. The second time, the black ball bounced away. The third time, the black ball flew onto the ceiling. The fourth time, the black ball shot around the room like a frighted sparrow, finally taking refuge in your jacket pocket. The fifth time, the black ball flew away at nearly the speed of light, breaking the edge of the pool table, shooting through the wall, and leaving the Earth and Solar system, just like Asimov once described. What would you think then?”\nIndeed, a demon’s pool table.\nAfter a long silence, Ding explained that physicists’ expensive “pool tables”—high-energy particle accelerators–constructed on different continents, have been consistently failing to yield the same results with the same experimental setup.\nNow imagine a similarly unlawful coin. When you flipped it, the first time, it gave you heads; the second time, it flew outside of the room; the third time, it hovered in midair humming like a hive of bees; the fourth time, it spun forever without landing, defying gravity’s grasp; the fifth time, it burst into flame and fizzled into ash, leaving only a scorch mark on the table.\n\n… there seemed to be no pattern.\n\nIn the story, the leap from a lack of pattern to Yang Dong’s last words that “physics has never existed” is too quick. In reality, physicists are never afraid of “no obvious patterns” because they know they are dealing with complex situations with many knobs and sometimes with worlds governed by probabilities, not certainties, as exemplified by quantum physics.\nYang’s true crisis arises not from “no pattern” nor is it from simple replication failures, but from a fundamental betrayal of both scientific methods and their underlying principles.",

    "text": "2.6 Betrayal of Scientific Methods\nScientific method is not a single recipe but a set of practices. We design experiments so they can be replicated. We build theories so they can predict. We subject hypotheses to conditions where they might be falsified. We rely on measurement and quantification so that results can be communicated and compared. We use statistical inference so that from noisy samples we can draw stable generalizations. And we expose findings to peer scrutiny so that knowledge accumulates collectively, not privately. All these are parts of scientific methods that allow scientists to verify findings, build consensus, and gradually construct a towering edifice of knowledge about the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies.\nHowever, all of these methods presuppose that the world itself is stable enough for yesterday’s data to apply tomorrow—uniformity of nature. Even failures to replicate previous results should be invariant. Without invariance, replication is meaningless, prediction impossible, falsification incoherent.\nYet, what Yang Dong and her peers were facing was a complete lack of patterns: identical setups yielded wildly different outcomes, so wild that even our best statistical tools could not capture the slight hint of invariance as if it were the demon’s coin.\nYang’s despair was not about complexity or chance—it was about the collapse of this scaffolding.

    "text": "2.7 Emmy Noether’s Gift\nYang Dong also killed herself because the Demon’s pool table broke the promises of all branches of physics, promises that follow Noether’s Theorem.\nIn 1915, Emmy Noether, German mathematician and lecturer at University of Göttingen without pay—merely because she was a woman—discovered a secret mathematical architecture beneath the laws of physics. She proved that, loosely speaking, whenever a physical system behaves the same regardless of where it is, when it is, or how it is oriented, there must exist a law of conservation.\nPhysicists call this kind of sameness a symmetry. We know the idea from everyday life: my left hand mirrors my right. If I flip one over, it overlays the other—a transformation that demonstrates the symmetry. Physicists extended this notion beyond mirror-images: a symmetry means the property of remaining invariant under any transformation. If a system remains the same from one moment to the immediate next, that is time symmetry. If it holds the same here as it does elsewhere—whether a nanometer or a million kilometers away, that is spatial symmetry. If it behaves the same no matter how we rotate it—even by the tiniest imperceptible angle, that is rotational symmetry. These are what physicists call continuous symmetries: sameness that holds not only in great leaps, but through every tiny shift so small that transformation is smooth.\nHer theorem reveals the astonishing consequence: every continuous symmetry guarantees a conservation law. Time symmetry guarantees energy is conserved. Spatial symmetry guarantees momentum is conserved. Rotational symmetry guarantees angular momentum is conserved.\nSymmetry is the premise; conservation the promise.",

Our faith, or should we say confidence (as science is not faith-based), in the symmetries of the structure of space and time, and Noether’s theorem would, at this point, be very hard to shake.\n\nFor Yang, who had as much faith as Lederman and Hill, this was the final betrayal. Symmetry was not just a mathematical trick but the deep covenant of nature. It was the bridge between invariance and conservation, the silent guarantor that science could still speak a coherent language. Everything that we ever know from physics, from quarks to quasars, is an illusion. To see symmetry dissolve was to see the pillars of the temple collapse.\nPhysics has never existed, and will never exist.\n\nThis document was last updated on September 4, 2025.",
