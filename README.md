# Unlawful Laws — A Philosopher’s Footnotes to *The Three-Body Problem*

A digital book blending philosophy of science, interactive simulations, and literary imagination, inspired by Liu Cixin’s *The Three-Body Problem*.  
Written for curious readers, science enthusiasts, and anyone interested in how knowledge breaks — and sometimes rebuilds — under chaos.

## 🧠 What’s This Book About?

Science once promised order, law, and prediction. But what happens when those promises collapse?

Guided by *The Three-Body Problem* and grounded in philosophy of science, this book journeys through:

- Epistemic breakdowns (e.g., replication crisis, induction failures)
- Chaotic systems and unpredictable futures
- Fragility and antifragility of scientific models
- Strategies for living with radical uncertainty

Each chapter includes interactive elements — from coin flips with drifting probabilities to chaotic orbits and AI classifier demos — to explore how science works when predictability fails.

---

## 🧭 Book Overview

The book is structured into three parts:

### Part I — When Laws Fail
- The illusion of stable laws
- Hume’s induction problem
- Machine learning’s unresolved models

### Part II — Modeling the Unlawful
- Astronomy and Trisolaran chaos
- Simulation vs. explanation
- Chaos, computation, and climate

### Part III — Living Beyond Law
- Fragility and antifragility
- Feyerabend and epistemic pluralism
- Strategies to live with radical uncertainty
