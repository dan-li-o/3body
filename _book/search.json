Drawing on insights from statistics, philosophy, machine learning, and nonlinear systems — and guided by events in sci-fi The Three-Body Problem — this book journeys through:\n\nEpistemic breakdowns (e.g., replication crisis, failed induction)\nChaotic systems (e.g., weather, climate, celestial mechanics)\nModel fragility and antifragility\nNew strategies to live with radical uncertainty\n\nEach chapter includes embedded interactive components to let you simulate scientific breakdowns — from drifting coin flips to collapsing orbits to AI model failure.",
